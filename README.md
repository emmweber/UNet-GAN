This repository contains files related to a trained 3D cGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) model designed to correct artifacts caused by breathing motion in diffusion-weighted images (DWI). Both the generator and discriminator networks are based on a pretrained 3D U-Net architecture, which has been fine-tuned for artifact correction in medical imaging.
